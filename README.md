# Top Bands - A Top Trumps project - by Yorick Brown

This is a small project to become more familiar with creating custom post types and templates in WordPress, as well as interacting with an API. It was a great way to learn and fun, too, and opens up a treasure box of ways to build web apps using WordPress.

I implemented the starter theme [Underslack](https://understrap.com/), which combines  _underscores with Bootstrap 4, both of which I’ve wanted to play with. 

I created a child theme to add styles and templates. I also used SASS, Gulp and Browsersync, for the first time (after using LESS and Grunt for a while).

Have a look at the repo for the [theme](https://github.com/yodiyo/top-band-theme) and the [custom template](https://github.com/yodiyo/top-band-theme/blob/master/loop-templates/content-single-api-post.php).

You can find a page of bands and artists here - [http://theyoricktouch.com/news/top-bands](http://theyoricktouch.com/news/top-bands)

The data is supplied by [Songkick API](https://www.songkick.com/developer) with relevant images from [Skiddle](https://www.skiddle.com/api/).

Still to come:
* Refined design and gamification
* In page form for adding bands
* Create more fun info from data - eg number of festivals, number of times playing big venues, billing, and more

You can simply add an artist and the data will be automatically generated from the APIs or you can add your own data.

I’ve added a user (contributor role), so feel free to add more Top Bands:
